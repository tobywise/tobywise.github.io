Alongside common complaints such as &amp;ldquo;Please stop bothering me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Why do you keep going on about this&amp;rdquo;, one that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a few times is &amp;ldquo;Yeah Python seems great, but it&amp;rsquo;s so slow&amp;rdquo;.
Sadly, this is correct - Python is slow compared to other languages, including Matlab. While arguably it makes up for this in other ways, speed is still important for many tasks.</description></item><item><title>Running online experiments using Google Firebase</title><link>http://localhost:1313/posts/firebase-for-online-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 15:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/firebase-for-online-testing/</guid><description>Online testing is becoming a popular way of running psychological experiments. Services such as Prolific allow large samples to be recruited and tested in a matter of hours.
However one aspect of this process that often has people confused is how exactly to host a task online and store data properly. Some services are available that make this straightforward, such as Gorilla, however many of us want flexibility beyond that provided by these services.</description></item></channel></rss>
