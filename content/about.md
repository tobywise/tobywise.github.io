I'm a Professor Anthony Mellows fellow based at the Department of Neuroimaging within the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's college London. I use computational modelling and neuroimaging to understand the mechanisms underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression.

I started my academic career with a BSc in Psychology and MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Sussex, before completing a PhD at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, where I focused on neuroimaging markers of depression and bipolar disorder. I then completed postdoctoral work at the UCL Max Planck Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research at UCL and the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences at Caltech supported by a Sir Henry Wellcome postdoctoral fellowship from the Wellcome trust.

_Please feel free to get in touch if you'd like to talk to me about anything research-related, whether it's science or career advice. Reaching out to random scientists can be intimidating for junior students/researchers, particularly if you're from a background that's under-represented in academia - I want to make it clear here that I will always welcome this.
